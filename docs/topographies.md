# Download the topography

On this page, you can access all the digital outputs of The Topography of Human-Computer Interaction. We share the topography as open-access files:
- 3D scans of the clay sculptures
- Contour maps in various formats
- Source files and data for remixing and reuse

All files are hosted on GitHub under a permissive CC0 license, so anyone in the HCI community — or beyond — can download, use, and adapt them freely. We encourage you to explore the topography, use it in your own work, or contribute ideas and improvements. [Visit the GitHub Repository.]({{site.data.download.github_repository}})

If you use or share these files, we’d love to hear about it! Please feel free to reach out or cite this project as:
