The Topography of Human-Computer Interaction is an interactive, collaborative project that maps the diverse landscape of the HCI field — quite literally.

Originally created for the Aarhus 2025 conference, this experience invites participants to sculpt a shared physical topography of HCI using modeling clay. Peaks and valleys emerge to represent areas of expertise, methods, and communities within our field, sparking conversations and connections among researchers and practitioners.

This website extends that experience by hosting the evolving digital topographies — including 3D scans and contour maps — freely available to the community under an open license.

We believe that HCI is a living, shifting terrain. By shaping this topography together, we can reflect on our own positions within it, discover new connections, and strengthen our community in facing shared challenges.
