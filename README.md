An interactive, collaborative representation of the Human-Computer Interaction landscape through physical and digital mapping.

## About

The **Topography of Human-Computer Interaction** is an innovative project that captures the evolving landscape of HCI through collaborative sculpture. Originally created for the Aarhus 2025 conference, this experience invites the HCI community to shape, reflect, and connect by creating both physical and digital maps of our shared field.

## Repository Structure

```
topography-of-hci/
├── docs/                    # Website source (Jekyll-based)
├── models/                  # Downloadable 3D models and assets
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Downloadable Models

The `/models` folder contains 3D models, contour maps, and related assets that you can freely download and use:

- **3D Digital Models**: High-resolution scans of physical clay sculptures
- **Contour Maps**: Topographical representations highlighting elevations and patterns
- **Source Files**: Original scan data and processing files

*Note: The models folder is currently being populated with content.*

## How It Works

1. **Physical Sculpting**: Participants add modeling clay to represent their HCI expertise areas
2. **3D Scanning**: Regular scans capture the evolving landscape using iPad LiDAR
3. **Digital Processing**: Scans are converted into 3D models and contour maps
4. **Community Sharing**: All materials are published openly for reuse and adaptation

## Getting Involved

### Create Your Own Topography
Want to recreate this experience in your community? You can:
- Download our materials and instructions from the website or [directly from GitHub](https://github.com/TorSalve/topography-of-hci)
- Share your results with the community

### Contribute to Development
- **Website**: Submit improvements to the Jekyll site in `/docs`
- **Models**: Contribute new topography models to `/models`

## License

This project uses different licenses for different components:

- **Models & Data** (`/models`): [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) - No rights reserved, freely usable for any purpose
- **Website Content** (`/docs`): [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) - Free to use with attribution

This approach ensures that:
- **Researchers** can freely use and build upon the models and data
- **Developers** can integrate and extend the processing tools
- **Communities** can adapt the methodology without legal barriers
