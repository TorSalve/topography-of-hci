# Topography of Human-Computer Interaction

The Topography of Human-Computer Interaction is an interactive experience and open resource that captures the evolving landscape of HCI through collaborative sculpture. Originating at Aarhus 2025, this project invites the community to shape, reflect, and connect by creating a physical and digital map of our shared field. Here, you can explore 3D models, contour maps, and learn how this topography grows with each contribution.
